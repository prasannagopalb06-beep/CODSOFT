#  Tic Tac Toe AI (CODSOFT AI Internship – Task 2)

This project implements an **unbeatable Tic Tac Toe AI** using the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**.  
It is developed as part of the **CODSOFT Artificial Intelligence Internship**.

The AI always plays optimally and either **wins or draws**, never losing to the human player.



##  Internship Details

- Internship Domain: Artificial Intelligence  
- Organization: CODSOFT  
- Task Number: Task 2  
- Task Name: Tic Tac Toe AI  
- Platform Used: Google Colab / Python  



##  Task Description

Develop an AI agent that plays Tic Tac Toe against a human player.  
The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to evaluate all possible game states and selects the best move.

This task helps in understanding:
- Game theory
- Search algorithms
- Decision-making in AI
- Alpha-Beta Pruning optimization



##  Technologies Used

- Python  
- Minimax Algorithm  
- Alpha-Beta Pruning  
- Console-based input/output  
- Google Colab  



##  How the AI Works

- Human player uses **X**
- AI uses **O**
- AI evaluates all possible moves recursively
- Uses Alpha-Beta Pruning to reduce computation
- Chooses the optimal move every turn



##  How to Run 

1. Open **Google Colab**
2. Create a new notebook
3. Copy and paste the Tic Tac Toe AI code into a cell
4. Run the cell
5. Enter row and column values (0–2) when prompted
6. Give a single space between row value and column value while entering the prompt
