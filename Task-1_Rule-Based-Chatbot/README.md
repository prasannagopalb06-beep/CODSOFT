#  Rule-Based Chatbot (CODSOFT AI Internship – Task 1)

This project is a **Rule-Based Chatbot** developed as part of the **CODSOFT Artificial Intelligence Internship**.  
The chatbot is implemented using **Python**, **Regular Expressions (Regex)**, and **Gradio**, and is executed using **Google Colab**.



##  Internship Details

- Internship Domain: Artificial Intelligence  
- Organization: CODSOFT  
- Task Number: Task 1  
- Task Name: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses  
- Platform Used: Google Colab  



##  Task Description

Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules.  
The chatbot identifies user queries using **pattern matching (Regex)** and returns appropriate responses.

This task helps in understanding:
- Basic Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Conversation flow
- Rule-based decision logic



##  Technologies Used

- Python  
- Regular Expressions (`re` module)  
- Gradio  
- Datetime module  
- Google Colab  



##  How It Works

- User enters a message
- Input is converted to lowercase
- Regex patterns are matched against predefined rules
- If a match is found, a response is returned
- If no match is found, a fallback response is shown



##  How to Run

1. Open **Google Colab**
2. Create a new notebook
3. Install Gradio:
```python
!pip install gradio
